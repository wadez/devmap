Hey everyone on the WorldWideWeb, I just learned something rad! I am going to share, so you can learn to HTML code like me!

### History of Hypertext
Dad says history is important. Without history, we are doomed to repeat our selves. You should know that HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Understanding HTML will allow you to turn text into something spectacular. Dad says scientists use HTML to share notes on topics like Space, Trucks, and Dinosaurs!

Back in the day, everyone was hyper about the internet. After all, the internet was created by Army soldiers. Dad says "Hyper" is the trend word because it means "beyond". Hypertext is beyond books and reports. It was beyond cool too! Anyone in the world with your address can access your write-ups. Neat!

### So What
With HTML, you can do anything a typewriter or typing software can do. You can create headings, italics, bold, underline, etc. That's lame! What is really cool is anchoring your page to someone else's page. With a single mouse click you can travel to anywhere in the WorldWideWeb (W3)!

The anchoring feature is perfect for referencing other documents. Dad says anchors help the sales department catch big fish. Dad knows nothing about fishing! You can anchor images, celebrity documents, and other totally awesome stuff!

Mom says you can make a web page for a school report and your teacher will gasp in astonishment! They will give you an "A+" and a sticker! So what do you say? Do you want to join the cool club of web developers?

### How to
Of course, you do! Let me show you, but first, you need an awesome school report like mine. No stealing!


    Wild Frogs
    Frogs are super rad! Did you know that some frogs have bright colors to scare hungry birds? That's right, birds won't eat some frogs because they are poisonous. 
    
    Types of Frogs
    There are tons of frogs in your world. Some live in your backyard while others live on the other side of the planet! Do not worry, you can read from the comfort of your home. I am going to provide book references so you can go to the library and look at pictures of frogs.
    
    Bull Frog
    This is just a standard frog. Nothing special. You have them all over your backyard. Trust me, go to Webb pond or Indian creek and you will surely find some. They have dark colored skin so they blend into the mud.
    
    Poison Dart Frog
    Holy cow! My friend Jeremiah told me about these frogs and I knew he was lying! I believed him after he showed me the book "Frogs and Toads" and there it was! The frog was black and had bright yellow spots and a long tail. He said some tadpoles never lose their tail. Mom says poison dart frogs live in the Amazon rain forest. The hippies are trying to save the trees. Without trees poison dart frogs will all die! 
    
    Conclusion
    Frogs are out of this world! I am going to ask my parents for a pet frog! My sister can take care of the dogs!


This report took forever! I spent 15 minutes on it! Guess what?! Learn to HTML code only takes 5 seconds! Just make a file called `report.html` on your computer.

Type your report into the `report.html` file. Then put tags around words. My dad uses the HTML cheat sheet below.


| Tag         | purpose                |
|-------------|------------------------|
| &lt;h1&gt;  | a big title            |
| &lt;h3&gt;  | a smaller title        |
| &lt;b&gt;   | bold                   |
| &lt;a&gt;   | anchor to another page |
| &lt;img&gt; | show an image          |


Now your report writing looks something like this!

    <h1>Wild Frogs</h1>
